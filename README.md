# mymeshnetwork

........from espMesh.............
This is a modification from the startHere example of painlessMesh.
This sends MeshTopology to serial port, which then received by the Python app on PC side.
The Python app will process the MeshTopology and visualize it.
Additionally, we can interact with the graph. A click on a node will pop up a dialog box.
Through the dialog box we can set and read parameters on a node.

The Python app is available at:

................................
plan for modification:
1. add oled display for each node.
2. add layer level for connection to internet.
3. add wifi power and distance calculation
4. add power indication
